# Pico Home Assistant

Home Assistant integration using Raspberry Pi Pico W for IoT sensor applications.

## Overview

This project contains four main applications for the Raspberry Pi Pico W, designed to work with WiFi networks and MQTT brokers.

## Release Information

### Current Release: v0.1.2-alpha

**Code Architecture & Reliability Improvements**

This release focuses on code quality, maintainability, and improved startup reliability:

#### üèóÔ∏è **Code Refactoring & Architecture**
- ‚úÖ **Shared Version Display Module** - Extracted common stdio initialization and version display functionality into reusable `version_display.c/h` components
- ‚úÖ **DRY Principle Implementation** - Eliminated code duplication across all three applications, reducing maintenance overhead
- ‚úÖ **Intelligent USB Initialization** - Replaced fixed delays with `stdio_usb_connected()` smart detection for faster, more reliable startup
- ‚úÖ **Timeout Protection** - Added 10-second timeout for headless operation when no USB connection is available
- ‚úÖ **Consistent User Experience** - All applications now have identical, professional version information display
- ‚úÖ **Improved Build System** - Updated CMakeLists.txt to properly link shared components across all executables

#### üîß **Technical Improvements**
- **Startup Performance**: Applications start immediately when USB is connected, instead of waiting fixed delays
- **Code Maintainability**: Single source of truth for stdio/version handling reduces bugs and simplifies updates  
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduced code duplication saves flash memory across all three applications
- **Developer Experience**: Cleaner main() functions focus on core application logic

#### üìä **Metrics**
- **Code Reduction**: ~400+ characters of duplicated code eliminated
- **Consistency**: 100% identical stdio initialization across all applications
- **Reliability**: Smart USB detection with fallback timeout for production deployments

**Note:** As an alpha release, this version is suitable for testing and development. APIs and configuration may change in future releases.

make -j4
```

#### Debug Level Examples

**For production (minimal output):**
```bash
-DDEBUG_LEVEL=0
```

**For development (full debugging):**
```bash
-DDEBUG_LEVEL=4
```

### Flashing the Firmware

1. Hold the BOOTSEL button while connecting the Pico W to USB
2. Copy the generated `.uf2` file to the Pico's mass storage device
3. The device will automatically reboot and start running your application

## Troubleshooting

### Common Build Issues

- **Missing PICO_SDK_PATH**: Ensure the Pico SDK is properly installed and the environment variable is set
- **WiFi credentials not defined**: All applications require WIFI_SSID and WIFI_PASSWORD to be set
- **MQTT_SERVER not defined**: The sensor application specifically requires MQTT broker configuration

### Runtime Issues

- **WiFi connection failures**: Check credentials and signal strength
- **MQTT connection issues**: Verify broker IP, port, and credentials
- **Home Assistant discovery problems**: Ensure MQTT integration is enabled in Home Assistant
